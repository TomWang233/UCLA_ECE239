# Course Project for UCLA ECE239AS Reinforcement Learning Theory and Applications
In this project, our team studied the paper DeepMimic: Example-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning of Physics-Based Character Skills, Peng et al, 2018. (https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/DeepMimic/) Several works have been done, including reproduce the results of the model, tune the hyper-parameters, and train the model with modified character.
